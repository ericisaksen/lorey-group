While leaving those assets in the former employer's plan is an option, a rollover can be a consideration. Working with your tax advisor, we can help you determine the right course of action for you. This may include: leaving the funds in your existing plan, if permitted, rolling them into your new employer's plan, if one is available and rollovers are permitted, rolling them over to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), or taking a cash distribution. Each choice offers advantages and disadvantages, depending on your specific needs, personal circumstances and the retirement plans, such as the desired investment options and services, applicable fees, expenses, and withdrawal options, as well as the required minimum distributions (RMDs) and tax treatment of the applicable options. </p><p class=\"pam-footnote\">We do not offer tax advice.
